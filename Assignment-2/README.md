Download the PreK dataset from Blackboard. This is the dataset used in the following paper:

Gormley Jr, William T., Ted Gayer, Deborah Phillips, and Brittany Dawson. "The effects of universal pre-K on cognitive development." Developmental psychology 41, no. 6 (2005): 872.

Answer the following questions (you may have to read the paper in order to answer some of them). Focus on the "wjtest01" outcome variable.

1. What is the research question? What causal effect are the authors attempting to estimate?
2. What feature of the data allow them to estimate this causal effect? How do they go about doing it?
3. Produce a plot that shows graphically how the authors estimate this causal effect
   1. What do you think is the most plausible way to estimate this caual effect with the available data? Estimate the causal effect this way. Things to think about might include:
   2. What functional form to use
   3. Which observations should you include or not include?
4. Which control variables could you include?
5. Is your estimate of the causal effect large? Can you put it in context?
6. Investigate whether your estimate in question 4 is robust to other plausible specifications. Summarize your robustness check with a plot.
